Calling Convention - It is a machine specific standard commonly prescribed
by the operating system for implementing a procedure in a module which
can be called from external modules. The calling convention specified by
a UNIX type system for x64 machine includes following guidelines for
using registers involved in a procedure call
1. The caller will pass first six integer type arguments in RDI, RSI, RDX,
   RCX, R8, R9 registers and will expect an integer type result in RAX
   register after the procedure returns.
2. The caller will preserve values in RAX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, R8-R11
   registers but will expect the other registers to be restored to their
   original values before the procedure returns.
